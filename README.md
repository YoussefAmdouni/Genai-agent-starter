# Agents with LangGraph

This repository contains code for learning and building agents with LangGraph. The content is created for proof-of-concept and training purposes to get started with agent creation.

## How to Run

Some of the files can be run as Jupyter Notebooks directly within Visual Studio Code for an interactive experience. Other files are intended to be run from an Anaconda terminal.

## LLM Usage

For testing purposes, this project uses small, free Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted locally via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

For production environments or more advanced testing, it is recommended to use a more robust solution like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for serving the models.
